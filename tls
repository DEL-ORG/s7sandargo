Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communication over a network, typically between a client and a server. It ensures privacy, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted over the network. Here's how TLS works:

Handshake Protocol: The TLS handshake is the first step in establishing a secure connection. During the handshake, the client and server agree on encryption algorithms and exchange cryptographic keys.
Key Exchange: The client sends a "Hello" message to the server, specifying which encryption algorithms and protocols it supports. The server responds with a "Hello" message of its own, along with its digital certificate, which includes its public key. The client verifies the server's certificate and generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it back to the server.
Session Key Generation: Both the client and server use the pre-master secret to independently generate a session key. This session key is used to encrypt and decrypt data during the session.
Encryption: Once the session key is established, the client and server begin encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). This ensures that data exchanged between them remains confidential.
Data Transfer: With the secure connection established, the client and server can now exchange data securely. All data transmitted over the network is encrypted using the session key, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
Authentication: TLS also provides mechanisms for server and, optionally, client authentication. Server authentication ensures that the client is connecting to the intended server, while client authentication verifies the identity of the client to the server.
TLS is widely used to secure various types of communication on the internet, including web browsing, email, instant messaging, and file transfer protocols. It has become the de facto standard for ensuring privacy and security in online transactions and communications.
